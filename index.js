/* The code contained in index.js sets up a web server using the Node js run time environment. I have created a set of functions that allow simple
   client to server communication. Although the functions actual data will change (perhaps only slightly) from game to game, the structure can be used
   as the foundation of most of the games we will make.*/

/* For this simple maths game and games in the future, a number of tools have been used in addition to the basic Node install. Firstly to make the 
   creation of the web server easier, the express framework has been used which just makes the same functionality possible in fewer lines and it makes
   tasks like serving the html pages to the users much easier. Secondly, what has made this multiplayer game creation not only possible but fast to
   create is the use of Socket.io which is a javascript library that allows for bi-directional communication between the users web browser and the 
   server but also makes this communication real time, which is what gives it an interactive feel. It basically manages socket connections meaning
   when a new user connects (at the moment just to localhost:8080 on my computer) they have a socket created for them. This socket is like a 
   communication channel between them and the server. This means that you can essentially send messages from server to client (or server to all 
   clients, a broadcast) and from client to server.*/

 /* When you have installed node you can install express and socket.io from the command line using the node package manager(npm). For example to 
    install socket.io you would type npm install socket.io and it should then be installed.*/

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// CODE START //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*  Firstly we define the main variables of the application which are needed regardless of the game logic or numer of players the game is for, 
    meaning that every game should have these as they are needed to create the http server and use sockets*/

// We use express to set up the application
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
// We create the http server 
var server = require('http').createServer(app);
// We use sockets for our communication and the sockets will communicate on the server created above
var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);


// This module is needed for this application as the game creates random usernames, the moniker module is used to generate these names 
var Moniker = require('moniker');

// Here we declare the file we want to send to the client when a new user connects to the server, in this example it is page.HTML
app.get('/', function(req,res) {
	res.sendFile(__dirname + '/page.HTML');
});
// We will run the web server on port 8080 which is the standard for a web server application
server.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);



/* This is the first use of socket.io in this application. io.sockets.on() is used when you are referring to all connections, so all the current
   players in the maths game. Here we are saying that when a new connection is established (which is detected automatically) then a socket is
   created for that connection and this socket is unique to that client. */

io.sockets.on('connection', function(socket){
	
	// Print out a log indicating there has been a new connection, just useful for testing
	console.log("Successful Connection!");

	// Here is where a new users state, in this case their name and current score(which will be initially zero) are set in the function addUser()
	// which is defined below, the new user values are stored in a variable user so that they can be displayed to the client.
	var user = addUser();
	// Here is the first use of emit, emit is a message and when it is socket.emit, then this means that a message is being sent to one client
	// only which will be the one defined by the socket argument passed in when the connection is established
	// Here the emit has a label of "Welcome", if you go to page .html you will see code starting with socket.on("Welcome", ...) which is acting as 
	// a listener waiting that causes some code to execute in the listener body. It is useful to imagine socket.on as listen and socket.emit as speak.
	// The second argument of socket.emit is the data to be sent across to the client, in this case we are sending the contents of the user variable
	// which if we remember is the state of the user (name and score).
	socket.emit("Welcome", user);

	// Method  to add new user to a list that contains all the connected users of the game.
	updateUsers();
	
	// Here socket.on (listening) is used to call a function that removes a user from the list of users when a user disconnects. If the user closes
	// the tab or turns off their computer, the connection is severed and so this disconnect listener is activated.
	socket.on('disconnect', function(){
		removeUser(user);
	});


	// Here we listen for an emit from a individual client containing their answer to the current question and check their answer against the actual 
	// answer, if it is correct then the server issues an emit to every connected user and the data attatched to that emit is a string containing the 
	// name of the user who answered the question correctly.
	// Finally we call the updateQuestion() function which will generate a new question and emit it to all users

	// Remember: io.sockets.emit is a message to all connected users
	// Remember: socket.emit is a message to one connected user (therefore socket.emit is contained within the connection body otherwise we would not
	// know who this user is).


	

	// Most of the code below is relates to the game logic but the code above is fairly core to whatever game you are creating



	socket.on('mathAnswer', function(data) {

		if(data == Gl_ans){
			user.score +=1;
			io.sockets.emit("corr_ans", { message: "<strong>" + user.name + "</strong> got it correct!" } );
			updateQuestion();
			
		};


		// First user to answer 10 questions correctly wins the game
		if(user.score == 10){
			io.sockets.emit("gameWon", { message: "<strong>" + user.name + "</strong> won the game!" });
			endGame();

	// Currently when the number of users is equal to 2, the game is started. However in future versions I hope to not have this hard coded but
	// rather let the user decide how many users they want to play with and then be added to the appropriate game.
	if(users.length == 2){


		// Future Changes...
		// Game logic and variables for those two players may have to be put in a function that is called 'inside'
		// the chatroom like environment and then the outer users.length could be reset to 0 for the next two players to
		// join
